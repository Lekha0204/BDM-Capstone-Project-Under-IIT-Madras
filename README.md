# ENHANCING OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY, SPACE AND INVENTORY MANAGEMENT AT 'JJ BEAUTY SALON'

This repository contains the completed project for the Business Data Management (BDM) subject at IIT-Madras. The objective of this project was to apply data management and analysis techniques to address the challenges faced by a business owner. The focus was on enhancing service efficiency, optimizing space, and implementing structured inventory and record-keeping at JJ Beauty Salon.
## Project Overview

The project analyzed transactional data from February 1 to March 4, 2025, digitized from the owner's manual records.
* **Key Problems Addressed:** Operational inefficiencies, space constraints, manual inventory tracking, and disparate paper-based record-keeping.
* **Core Analysis:** Applied comparative analysis to segment services into high-volume/low-margin and high-value/low-frequency categories.

* **Key Technique:** **ABC Analysis**- Employed ABC Inventory Classification to prioritize high-cost stock items based on the Pareto principle for optimized procurement and stock control.

## Key Results and Recommendations

The analysis led to actionable strategies for optimized resource allocation:

* **Scheduling:** Recommend aligning staffing models with validated peak demand periods (weekends and late afternoon/early evening hours).
* **Profitability:** Implement strategies to leverage high-margin service capacity during off-peak times and optimize efficiency in high-volume operations.
* **Inventory:** Institute differentiated inventory controls, focusing resource-intensive monitoring on high-priority stock items.
* **Digitization:** Proposed transitioning to digital record-keeping (Google Sheets/Excel) for streamlined data validation, trend analysis, and decision support.
